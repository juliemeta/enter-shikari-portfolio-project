            <h2>Who is Enter Shikari?</h2>
            <h3>Strong lyrics</h3>
            <p>
              In 2003 Enter Shikari was formed in St. Albans, Uk, by members Rou
              Reynolds (lead vocals and lyricist), Rory Clewlow (guitarist), Rob
              Rolfe (drummer) and Chris Batten (bassist). <br />
              Their songs typically revolve around lyrical themes such as
              climate change, capitalism, social issues and the like.

            <h3>Eclectic musical universe</h3>
            <p>
              Enter Shikari is a rock band combining a bunch of subgenres
              including electronic, alternative, heavy, punk... you name it!
              This eclectic combo means that their musical repertoire is always
              renewing and very diverse. When comparing their debut album "Take
              to the Skies" from 2007 and one of their newer releases like
              "Nothing is True and Everything is Possible", it becomes clear
              just how diverse their musical talent is. Listen for yourself and
              try to decipher all the genres you think define their music.

            <h3>Best live act</h3>
            <p>
              One of the reasons fans are dedicated to the band is their
              performance on stage which is a high-energy explosive experience.
              <br />
              Whether Enter Shikari is performing in a small venue like
              Pumpehuset in Copenhagen or a big stage like O2 Victoria Warehouse
              in Manchester they manage to maintain a great connection with the
              audience. They even performed a sold out show at the Wembley Arena
              in London.
